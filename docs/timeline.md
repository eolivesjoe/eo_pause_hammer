# PauseHammer: Development Timeline & Considerations

This document outlines the estimated development time and key safety considerations for building PauseHammer.

---

## Development Timeline

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – 1–2 hours
- Find process by name
- Enumerate and suspend all threads
- Register a global hotkey
- Resume all threads on second press
- Log output to console

### Structured Version – 4–6 hours
- Modularize code: process_utils, thread_manager, hotkey_handler, logger
- Create a CMake build system
- Add basic error handling and API safety
- Add logging to file for better traceability

### Optional Features – As needed
- Allow user input for process name
- Advanced logging with timestamps
- GUI using WinForms or ImGui
- System tray integration and silent mode
- Configurable hotkeys

---

## Safety Considerations

### General
- Use SuspendThread and ResumeThread carefully
- Always CloseHandle after opening a handle
- Avoid calling SuspendThread more than once per thread
- Keep track of suspended thread IDs or handles if needed

### Safe Use Cases
- Single-player games
- Offline applications
- Lightweight tools or utilities

### Risky Use Cases
- Games with anticheat (e.g., Easy Anti-Cheat, BattleEye)
- Online multiplayer games (may trigger timeouts or bans)
- System processes or services (can lead to instability)

### Technical Risks
- Threads created after suspension will still run
- Multiple suspensions require equal resumes
- Improper handling may freeze or crash the process
- GPU/Rendering might stop (expected behavior in some engines)

---

## Best Practices
- Resume all threads you suspend
- Use logging to trace suspend/resume events
- Implement a failsafe hotkey to restore normal state
- Test only on known-safe, non-critical processes

---

## Verdict
PauseHammer is safe for personal use with offline apps and games.
Use caution with anything involving online play or anticheat protection.
