# PauseHammer

PauseHammer is a lightweight Windows utility that lets you globally pause and resume a running application using a hotkey. Execellent for single player games that won't let you pause cutscenes.

## Features
- Suspend/resume any target application with a hotkey (`CTRL + P`)
- Useful for pausing single-player games, tools, or simulations

## Usage
Run the program and pass the target application's .exe name i.e `pause_hammer.exe Balatro.exe` 

### Use responsibly. Suspending the wrong process may lead to system instability.
### Use at your own risk, especially with online games or networked applications. Pausing these may cause data loss, disconnections, or bans.
